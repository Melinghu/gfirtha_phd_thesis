  abstract  = {This paper revisits the popular Rayleigh integral approximation, and also considers a second approximation, the high frequency boundary element method which is similar to the Rayleigh integral. Both methods are approximations to the boundary integral equation, and can solve problems in a fraction of the time required by the conventional boundary element method. The development of both methods from the Helmholtz integral equation is demonstrated and the differences between the two methods are delineated. Both methods were compared on practical examples including a running engine, gearbox, and construction cab. It was concluded that both methods can reliably predict the sound power for many problems but are inaccurate for sound pressure computations.},

  abstract = {The synthesis of directional sources using wave field synthesis is described. The proposed formulation relies on an ensemble of elementary directivity functions based on a subset of spherical harmonics. These can be combined to create and manipulate directivity characteristics of the synthesized virtual sources. The WFS formulation introduces artifacts in the synthesized sound field for both ideal and real loudspeakers. These artifacts can be partly compensated for using dedicated equalization techniques. A multichannel equalization technique is shown to provide accurate results thus enabling for the manipulation of directional sources with limited reconstruction artifacts. Applications of directional sources to the control of the direct sound field and the interaction with the listening room are discussed.},
