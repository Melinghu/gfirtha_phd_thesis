In the previous chapters the description and reproduction of stationary sound fields were discussed.
The presented sound field synthesis methods, however, are not restricted to the synthesis of stationary sound fields.
In addition to the static case, the synthesis of moving sources gained increasing interest in the related literature, rising as an obvious need when dynamic sound fields has to be synthesized.
This chapter deals with the synthesis of the sound fields generated by moving sources of sound, constituting a complex application example for the foregoing.

In this dynamic case, the primary challenge is the proper reconstruction of the \emph{Doppler effect}, occurring due to the constant, finite wave propagation velocity in a homogeneous medium:
Since wavefronts generated by a source under motion propagate away from the excitation position with a finite sound speed, therefore, in front of the source---towards the direction of the source motion---the wavefronts are compressed, while behind the source a rarefaction of wavefronts occurs.
This phenomenon results in a modified, time dependent attenuation factor and a clearly audible altered perceived frequency in case of a harmonic source excitation, termed as the \emph{Doppler shift}.

The proper reconstruction of the Doppler effect is inherently solved when analytical source models are applied.
Thus, first the analytical description of a sound field generated by a moving source is investigated.

\section{Description of moving sources}

This section extends the description and the concept of high frequency/asymptotic properties of stationary sound fields to the particular case of a moving 3D point source.
The solution obtained in the following can be applied in order to describe spatially extended moving sources, while an inclusion of source directivity can be found in \cite{Warren1976, Ahrens2011_moving_source_WFS}.

\subsection{Time domain description}

First, the time domain description of the field excited by a 3D point source under motion is examined in details \cite{Dowling1983, deHoop2005}.
Assume a point source moving along an arbitrary trajectory with an arbitrary velocity profile, with the source location time history given by $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{x(t)}{y(t)}{z(t)}$.
The spatio-temporal impulse response of such a moving source, satisfying the inhomogeneous wave equation
\begin{equation}
\left( \Dx^2 -\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \right) g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx-\vxs(\tE),t-\tE) = -\delta\left( \vx - \vxs(\tE) \right) \cdot \delta\left( t - \tE \right),
\label{Eq:moving_source:Green_function_def}
\end{equation}
is given by the \emph{retarded Green's function} \cite{Jackson1999}
\begin{equation}
g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx-\vxs(\tE),t-\tE) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\delta( t - \tE - \frac{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|}{c} )}{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|}.
\label{Eq:moving_source:retarded_greens}
\end{equation}
Time instant $\tE$ is referred to as the \emph{emission time}, being the time instant at which the impulse was emitted that arrives to the receiver position $\vx$ at the time instant $t$.
Formally, the field of a moving impulsive point source is obtained from the stationary Green's function, by letting the source position to be the function of time.
A moving point source, therefore, radiates spherical wavefronts with the center being the source position at the emission time.
This general case is illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Moving_source:source_geometry}.
	
The field generated by a moving source with a source excitation time history $s(t)$ can be obtained by modeling the excitation signal as the continuous sequence of Dirac pulses \cite{Girod2001, Ahrens2012}.
The weight of each source pulse in the received signal is given by the retarded Green's function, describing the wave propagation from the source position at the emission time to the receiver position at the receiver time.
The radiated field, therefore, can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moving_source:non_stat_convolution}
p_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tE) g_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx-\vxs(\tE),t-\tE) \td \tE =  
\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tE)  \frac{\delta( t - \tE - \frac{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|}{c} )}{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|} \td \tE.
\end{equation}
The expression describes a non-stationary convolution with the time-variant convolution kernel being the moving source impulse response \cite{Margrave1998}.

	\label{Fig:Moving_source:source_geometry}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}  

The convolution can be evaluated by the generalization of the Dirac delta's sifting property for arguments of general functions \cite{Dowling1983, Crighton1992, Jackson1999}, given as\footnote{Equivalently, the same result is obtained by introducing a new variable for $t'(\tE) = \tE + |\vx-\vxs(\tE)|/c$.}
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \, \delta(g(t)) \, \td t = \sum_{i} \frac{f(t_i)}{\left| \frac{\td}{\td t} g(t) \right|_{t = t_i}}, \hspace{5mm} \text{where} \hspace{5mm} g(t_i) = 0.
\end{equation}
%Hence, the Dirac delta sifts out the function values at the zeroes of its argument.

In the present case the derivative of the argument (i.e. the Jacobian) is expressed by applying the chain rule, resulting in
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moving_source:jacobian}
\frac{\td }{\td \tE} g(\tE) = 
\frac{\td }{\td \tE} \left( t - \tE - \frac{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|}{c}  \right) =
- 1 + \frac{1}{c} \frac{\left< \frac{\partial}{\partial \tE} \vxs(\tE) \cdot (\vx-\vxs(\tE))\right> }{|\vx-\vxs(\tE)|}.
\end{equation}
The temporal derivative of the source trajectory $\vvs(\tE) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \tE}\vxs(\tE)$ can be recognized as the source velocity vector at the emission time.
Convolution with the Dirac delta sifts out the zeros of its argument given by the emission time for which
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moving_source:emission_time}
\tE(t,\vx) = t - \frac{|\vx-\vxs(\tE(t,\vx))|}{c}
\end{equation}
holds.
Obviously, the emission time depends on the receiver position $\vx$, the receiving time $t$ and the source trajectory $\vxs$.
%For subsonic velocities (i.e.\ $v<c$) only the positive real root for this quadratic equation is considered, while the Jacobian \eqref{eq:moving_source:jacobian} is negative.
With all these considerations the non-stationary convolution \eqref{eq:moving_source:non_stat_convolution} can be evaluated yielding the sound field of a moving point source
\begin{equation}
p_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t) =
\frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{ s(t - \frac{|\vx-\vxs(\tE(\vx,t))|}{c} ) }{|\vx-\vxs(\tE(\vx,t))| - \frac{1}{c}\left< \vvs(\tE(\vx,t)) \cdot (\vx-\vxs(\tE(\vx,t)))\right> },
\end{equation}
where $\tE$ satisfies the implicit equation \eqref{eq:moving_source:emission_time}.

Conventionally, the radiated field is expressed in terms of the propagation time delay $\tau(\vx,t) = t - \tE(\vx,t)$ defined by the implicit quadratic equation
\importanteq{Propagation time delay}{
\tau(\vx,t) =  \frac{| \vx - \vxs( t - \tau(\vx,t)) |  }{c}.
\label{eq:tau}
}
For subsonic velocities only this positive root of the quadratic equation ($\tau(\vx,t)>0$) is taken into consideration \citep{deHoop2005}. 
In the present thesis exclusively subsonic velocities are discussed.
For a detailed discussion on sources moving at supersonic velocities refer to \cite{Ahrens2008moving_b, Ahrens2012}.
Introducing $\Delta(\vx,t)$ for the attenuation factor the radiated field is given as
\importanteq{Field of a moving source}{
p_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{s( t - \tau( \vx,t ) )}{\Delta(\vx,t-\tau( \vx, t ))},
\label{eq:moving_source_field}
}
with
\begin{equation}
\Delta( \vx,t ) = |\vx - \vxs(t)| - \left<\, \frac{1}{c}\vvs(t) \cdot (\vx - \vxs(t)) \right> 
 =  |\vx - \vxs(t)|\left( 1 - M(t) \cos \vartheta(\vx,t) \right),
\label{eq:delta}
\end{equation}
where $M(t) = |\vvs(t)|/c$ is the \emph{Mach number}, $\vartheta(\vx,t)$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the source-receiver vector and the term $\left( 1 - M(t) \cos \vartheta(\vx,t) \right)^{-1}$ is referred to as the \emph{Doppler factor}. % describing whether the source moves towards to or away from the receiver position.
The geometry along with the used notation is illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Moving_source:source_geometry}.
%
Equation \eqref{eq:delta} states that as a part of the Doppler effect, due to the compression of wavefronts towards the direction of the source motion the resulting spatial amplitude distribution of the wavefield increases compared to that of a stationary source.
Similarly, behind the moving source due to the rarefaction of the wavefronts the amplitude of the source decreases.
This relative change of the attenuation factor is described by the Doppler factor.

%    In this special case of uniform motion the amplitude distribution is axially symmetric with the axis being perpendicular to the source trajectory.
    }
\label{fig:Moving_sources:moving_source_field}  
\end{figure}

The evaluation of the radiated field emitted by a moving source is not straightforward: 
It requires the determination of the emission time or the propagation time delay by solving \eqref{eq:moving_source:emission_time} or \eqref{eq:tau} for any receiver position and receiver time.
Analytical solutions for the general problem are barely available.
For the special case of a sound source under uniform motion---i.e. moving along a straight trajectory with constant velocity---the quadratic equations can be solved.
For a source moving parallel with the $x$-axis (with the source position vector given by $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{v \cdot t}{0}{0}$) the propagation time delay and the attenuation factor read as
\begin{equation}
\tau(\vx,t) = \frac{|\vx-\vxs(t_e(\vx,t))|}{c} = \frac{M (x-v t)+\Delta(\vx,t)}{c \, (1-M^2)},
\label{fig:Moving_sources:tau_uniform}  
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Delta(\vx,t) = \sqrt{(x-vt)^2+(y^2+z^2)(1-M^2)},
\label{fig:Moving_sources:delta_uniform}
\end{equation}
with $M = \frac{v}{c}$ being the time independent Mach number.
For sources moving inclined to the $x$-axis, the corresponding quantities can be obtained by a rotation of the coordinate system, as discussed in Appendix \ref{App:Moving_source_representations} \cite{firtha2015sound, Ahrens2015:web, firtha2016wave}.

\subsection{Time-frequency domain description}
In order to extend the asymptotic, local attributes of sound fields (introduced for steady-state sound fields in Chapter \ref{sec:high_freq_approx}) for the dynamic scenario, a mixed time-frequency representation of moving sources is investigated next.
Assume a moving source with a harmonic excitation time dependence given by $s(t) = \te^{\ti \omega_0 t}$, oscillating at the angular frequency $\omega_0$.
The radiated field reads as
\begin{equation}
P_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t,\omega_0) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{\te^{\ti \omega_0\left( t - \tau( \vx,t )\right)}}{\Delta(\vx,t-\tau( \vx, t ))}.
\label{eq:harmonic_moving_source_field}
\end{equation}

An arbitrary non-stationary sound field can be written in a general polar form $P_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t,\omega_0) = A^P(\vx,t,\omega_0) \, \te^{\ti \phi^P(\vx,t,\omega_0)}$, with $A^P(\vx,t,\omega_0),\phi^P(\vx,t,\omega_0) \in \mathbb{R}$.
For such a harmonic field the local wavenumber vector can be defined in as the negative phase gradient
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HF_appr:general_loc_wn}
\vk^P(\vx,t) = [k_x^P(\vx,t),\ k_y^P(\vx,t),\ k_z^P(\vx,t)]^{\mathrm{T}} = -\Dx \phi^P(\vx,t,\omega_0),
\end{equation}
similarly to the stationary case.
This vector is perpendicular to the isophase surfaces---i.e. to the wavefront---at an arbitrary position and time instant, pointing into the local propagation direction of the wavefront.
In the case of a moving point source, the local wavenumber vector is given by the phase gradient of \eqref{eq:harmonic_moving_source_field}, reading
\importanteq{Moving source local wavenumber}{
\label{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_loc_wn}
\vk^P(\vx,t) = -\Dx \phi^P(\vx,t,\omega_0) = \frac{\omega_0}{c} \frac{\vx -\vxs(t-\tau(\vx,t))}{\Delta(\vx, t-\tau(\vx,t))}.
}

The local dispersion relation and the attenuation over the propagation path for a general non-stationary sound field is obtained by substituting the polar form of sound fields into the time domain wave equation \eqref{Eq:Theory:Scalar_wave_equation} and expanding the differential operators.
Requiring the real and imaginary parts to equal to zero results in the set of equations
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:HF_appr:moving_eikonal}
\frac{\Lx A^P}{A^P}  - | \Dx \phi^P |^2 -\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{A^{P''}_{tt}}{A^P} +\frac{1}{c^2}|\phi^{P'}_{t}|^2 = 0, \\ 
\label{eq:HF_appr:transport_eq_non_stat}
\Lx \phi^P + 2\frac{ \left< \Dx \phi^P \cdot \Dx A^P \right> }{A^P} - \frac{1}{c^2} \phi^{P''}_{tt} - \frac{1}{c^2} 2\frac{A^{P'}_t \phi^{P'}_t }{A^P} = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
For a moving point source the above equations are singular at the source position, following \eqref{Eq:Theory:Green_function_def}.

Under high frequency conditions \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_eikonal} yields the local dispersion relation 
\importanteq{Moving source local dispersion relation}{ \label{eq:HF_appr:eikonal_eq_non_stat}
| \Dx \phi^P |^2 = |\vk^P(\vx,t)|^2 \approx \frac{1}{c^2}|\phi^{P'}_{t}|^2.
}
For a point source under motion the local dispersion relation holds with equality, excluding the moving singularity.
Hence, unlike for the stationary case, the length of the local wavenumber vector is not constant\footnote{As a result, the wavefront is not described by a normal form, as for the stationary case.} but depends on both the receiver position and time:
The temporal derivative of the phase function can be recognized as the generalization of the perceived angular frequency at a fixed receiver position \cite{Morse1968}.
For the case of a moving virtual point source the perceived frequency can be expressed as 
\importanteq{Perceived angular frequency}{
\label{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_per_freq}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi^P(\vx,t) =  \omega(\vx,t) = \omega_0  \frac{|\vx-\vxs(t-\tau(\vx,t))|}{\Delta(\vx,t-\tau(\vx,t))} = \frac{  \omega_0  }{1 - M(t) \cos \vartheta(\vx,t) }.
}
This expression is the general Doppler formula, describing the relative frequency shift of a harmonic source signal due to the source motion\cite{Morse1968}. 
Thus, both the perceived frequency and amplitude distribution is altered, and the alteration is described by the Doppler factor.
%The local dispersion relation \eqref{eq:HF_appr:eikonal_eq_non_stat} states that the local wavenumber vector is perpendicular to the wavefront with the length being proportional to the local perceived angular frequency.
According to the local dispersion relation, the normalized local wavenumber vector---defined as being a unit vector pointing to the local propagation direction---can be generalized as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Moving_source:local_wn_general}
\hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t) = -\frac{\Dx \phi^P(\vx,t)}{\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi^P(\vx,t)}  = \frac{\vk^P(\vx,t)}{ \omega(\vx,t)/c }.
\end{equation}
For the particular case of a moving point source the normalized local wavenumber vector is given from \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_loc_wn} and \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_per_freq} as
\importanteq{Normalized local wavenumber}{
\label{eq:Moving_source:norm_local_wn_moving_source}
\hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t) = \frac{\vx -\vxs(t-\tau(\vx,t))}{|\vx-\vxs(t-\tau(\vx,t))|},
}
reflecting the fact that a moving point source radiates spherical wavefronts with the center being the source position at the emission time instant.
\begin{figure}

	\label{Fig:Moving_source:moving_source_local_wn}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}  

Finally, in the non-stationary case, the transport equation \eqref{eq:HF_appr:transport_eq_non_stat} takes the form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Moving_source:transport_eq}
\frac{ \left< \hat{\vk}^P \cdot \Dx A^P \right>+\frac{1}{c} A^{P'}_t }{A^P}  = \frac{1}{2} \frac{ \Lx \phi^P - \frac{1}{c^2} \phi^{P''}_{tt} }{\frac{1}{c}\phi^{P'}_t}
\end{equation}
The left-hand side of the equation can be interpreted as the relative amplitude change of the radiated wavefront over its propagation path (with the point of investigation moving along with the wavefront).
%Mathematically, it is given by the rate of change of the amplitude factor with respect to a change $\td x$ in the receiver position into the direction of $\hat{\vk}$ and a change $\frac{\td x}{c}$ in the receiving time.
The right-hand side of the equation can be recognized as the general local mean curvature of the wavefront \cite[4.2]{Goldman2005},\footnote{As given in \cite{Goldman2005}, the mean curvature of a general implicit surface $F$ is given by 
$\overline{\kappa}^F(\vx) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\Dx F^{\mathrm{T}} H^F \Dx F - |\Dx F|^2 \Lx F }{|\Dx F|^3}$. In the present case also $\frac{1}{c^2} \phi^{P''}_{tt} = \frac{\Dx \phi^{\mathrm{T}} \, \mH^P(\vx) \, \Dx \phi}{|\Dx \phi|^2}$ holds.} thus \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:transport_eq} can be rewritten as
\begin{multline}
\overline{\kappa}^P(\vx,t) = -\frac{1}{2}\Dx \cdot \hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t)= \\
-\frac{ \left< \hat{\vk}^P \cdot \Dx A^P \right>+\frac{1}{c} A^{P'}_t }{A^P} = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{ \Lx \phi^P  }{ \omega(\vx,t)/c } - \frac{ \hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t)^{\mathrm{T}} \, \mH^P(\vx) \, \hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t) }{ \omega(\vx,t)/c } \right).
\label{Eq:Moving_source:attenuation}
\end{multline}
Equation \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:attenuation} reflects that similarly to the stationary case, the relative attenuation of the wavefront over the propagation is given by the local mean curvature of the wavefront.
Obviously, for a moving point source the mean curvature is given as
\begin{equation}
\overline{\kappa}^P(\vx,t) = \kappa^P_{1/2}(\vx,t) = \frac{1}{|\vx-\vxs(t-\tau(\vx,t))|}.
\label{Eq:Moving_source:attenuation_2}
\end{equation}
Therefore, although the spatial distribution of the amplitude factor is altered according to the Doppler factor, the attenuation of the individual wavefronts over the propagation path is inversely proportional to the distance from the source position at the emission time instant, just like in the stationary case.
Obivously, this result exactly coincides with the definition of the retarded Green's function \eqref{Eq:moving_source:retarded_greens}.

\section{Wave Field Synthesis of moving sources}
\label{Sec:Moving_source_WFS}

So far only boundary integral formulations of steady-state sound fields were discussed merely in the frequency domain.
In order to synthesize the temporally varying sound field of a moving point source by using implicit SFS methodology, an appropriate time domain boundary integral representation of arbitrary sound fields is required.

Assume a source-free volume inside an enclosure $\Oi$, bounded by the surface $\dO$.
Any sound field obeying the homogeneous time domain wave equation inside the enclosure can be expressed by the \emph{time domain Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral equation}.
The formulation is obtained by the temporal inverse Fourier transform of the frequency domain KHIE \eqref{Eq:Theory:Kirchhoff-Helmholtz} by exploiting the Fourier convolution theorem, resulting in
\importantmline{Time domain KHIE}{
p(\vx,t) = \oint_{\dO} \int_{t_0} p(\vxo,t_0) \frac{\partial}{\partial \vni} g(\vx - \vxo, t - t_0) - 
\\ 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \vni}  p(\vxo,t_0) g(\vx - \vxo, t - t_0) \, \td t_0 \, \td \dO(\vxo),
}
with $\vx \in \Oi$.	

For convex boundaries and with high frequency conditions---i.e. source excitation signals with dominant high frequency content---the tangent plane approximation \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:tangent_plane} holds and the above integral can be approximated by the \emph{time domain Kirchhoff approximation}
\importanteq{Time domain Kirchhoff approx.}{
\label{eq:theory:KA_td}
p(\vx,t) \approx -2 \oint_{\dO} \int_{t_0} w(\vxo,t_0) \, \frac{\partial}{\partial \vni}  p(\vxo,t_0) \, g(\vx - \vxo, t - t_0) \, \td t_0 \, \td \dO(\vxo),
}
obtained by the temporal inverse Fourier transform of equation \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:Kirchhoff_appr}.
The integral describes an arbitrary sound field in terms of a spatio-temporal convolution over the boundary surface.
The convolution kernel is the time domain Green's function (and in the KHIE its normal derivative), defining the spatio-temporal impulse response of a point source on the boundary at $\vxo$, emitting an impulse at $t_0$.
The time dependent windowing function can be defined by assuming a harmonic time dependency for which the local wavenumber vector is defined as \eqref{eq:HF_appr:general_loc_wn}. 
The windowing function the given as
\begin{equation}
w(\vxo,t_0) = \begin{cases}
                        1, \hspace{3mm} \forall \hspace{3mm} \langle \vk^P(\vxo,t_0) \cdot \vni(\vxo) \rangle > 0 \\
                        0  \hspace{3mm} \text{elsewhere},
                    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
being a straightforward generalization of the stationary case.

%Similarly to the stationary case, for the special geometry of the boundary being an infinite plane the Kirchhoff approximation degenerates to the time domain Rayleigh integral, describing an arbitrary pressure field in front of the Rayleigh plane without any approximations involved.

\subsection{3D Wave Field Synthesis of a moving point source}

The general sound field synthesis problem formulation can be given in the time domain by taking the temporal inverse Fourier transform of the single layer potential \eqref{Eq:Theory:3D_SFS}
\begin{equation}
p(\vx,t) = \oint_{\dO} \int_{t_0} d(\vxo,t_0) g(\vx - \vxo , t-t_0 ) \, \td t_0 \, \td \dO ( \vxo ).
\label{eq:moving_source:SFS_problem_td}
\end{equation}

Comparison with \eqref{eq:theory:KA_td} reveals that similarly to the stationary case, the time domain Kirchhoff approximation implicitly contains the required time domain driving signals, reading
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moving_source:3D_wfs_driv_fun_td}
d(\vxo,t_0) =  -2 w(\vxo,t_0) \frac{\partial}{\partial \vni}  p(\vxo,t_0).
\end{equation}
By assuming a harmonic source time dependency, the high frequency gradient approximation can be applied for a non-stationary sound field, reading
\begin{equation}
\Dx P(\vx,t,\omega_0) \approx - \ti \vk^P(\vx,t) P(\vx,t,\omega_0),
\label{eq:moving_source:gradient_appr_nonstat}
\end{equation}
which is, again, a local plane wave approximation.
The general 3D WFS driving function can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moving_source:3D_wfs_driv_fun}
D(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0) =  2 w(\vxo,t_0) \, \ti k_{\mathrm{n}}^P(\vxo,t_0) \, P(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0),
\end{equation}
with $k_{\mathrm{n}}^P$ being the normal component of the local wavenumber vector.

Suppose that a point source moves along an arbitrary trajectory $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{x(t)}{y(t)}{z(t)}$ outside the listening volume bounded by a convex SSD.
The sound field generated by the moving point source satisfies the homogeneous wave equation inside the listening volume, therefore, it can be described by the Kirchhoff integral, and its sound field can be reproduced by applying the driving function above.
In case of a harmonic source excitation with the angular frequency being $\omega_0$, the driving function is obtained from \eqref{eq:moving_source:3D_wfs_driv_fun} by substituting the pressure field and the local wavenumber vector of a moving point source given by \eqref{eq:harmonic_moving_source_field} and \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_loc_wn}, respectively.
The resulting driving function reads as
\importanteq{3D WFS driving function}{
D(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0) =  w(\vxo,t_0) 
\frac{\ti k_0}{2\pi} \frac{\left< \vxo -\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0)) \cdot \vni(\vxo) \right>}{\Delta(\vxo,t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}
\frac{\te^{\ti \omega_0\left( t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 )\right)}}{\Delta(\vxo,t_0-\tau( \vxo, t_0 ))},
}
with $k_0 = \frac{\omega_0}{c}$, the amplitude factor given as
\begin{equation}
\Delta( \vxo,t_0 ) = |\vx - \vxs(t_0)| - \left<\, \frac{1}{c}\vvs(t_0) \cdot (\vx - \vxs(t_0)) \right>,
\end{equation}
and the propagation time delay satisfies 
\begin{equation}
\tau(\vxo,t_0) = \frac{| \vxo - \vxs( t_0 - \tau(\vxo,t_0)) |}{ c }.
\end{equation}
For sources with a wideband excitation signal with the frequency content $S(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t) \te^{-\ti \omega t} \td t$ the driving function is yielded by the weighted sum of the individual spectral components
\begin{equation}
d(\vxo,t_0) \! = \! w(\vxo,t_0)  
\frac{\left< \vxo -\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0)) \cdot \vni(\vxo) \right>}{\Delta(\vxo,t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))^2}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\ti \omega_0}{2\pi c} S(\omega_0 )\te^{\ti \omega_0\left( t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 )\right)} \td \omega_0,
\end{equation}
describing a temporal inverse Fourier transform taken at $t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 )$.
By realizing that multiplication by $\ti \omega_0$ performs the temporal differentiation of the input signal, the time domain driving function takes the form
\importanteq{3D time domain driving function}{
d(\vxo,t_0) =   
\frac{\left< \vxo -\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0)) \cdot \vni(\vxo) \right>}{\Delta(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))} \,
\frac{w(\vxo,t_0)}{2\pi c} \,
\frac{s'_t( t_0 - \tau( \vx,t_0 ) )}{\Delta(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}.
}	
Comparison with \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:3D_WFS_ps_driv_fun} and \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:3D_WFS_ps_driv_fun_td} indicates that the moving source driving function coincides with that for a stationary point source with the static distances/attenuation factors replaced with the dynamic ones.

As a simple example, Figure \ref{fig:SFS_theory:3D_WFS_moving_source} shows the result of synthesizing a point source under uniform motion.
For the sake of computational simplicity, the SSD is chosen to be invariant along the $z$-dimension, as it was illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SFS_theory:WFS_geometry}.
For sources under uniform motion the propagation time delay and the amplitude distribution can be expressed analytically, given by \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:tau_uniform} and \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:delta_uniform}, respectively.
Similarly to the stationary case, the above driving function ensures amplitude correct synthesis over the listening area within the validity of the Kirchhoff approximation.
Apart from the errors discussed for the case of the synthesis of a stationary point source---illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SFS_theory:3D_WFS_moving_source}---in this dynamic case amplitude and phase errors arise as the source approaches the SSD surface where the high frequency/farfield gradient approximation does not hold.

\subsection{The time domain 2.5D Kirchhoff approximation}

In order to reproduce the sound field of a moving source by applying a contour of secondary sources, an appropriate 2.5D integral representation is required.
The dimensionality reduction is, again, performed by the stationary phase approximation of the Kirchhoff integral, resulting in the \emph{time domain 2.5D Kirchhoff approximation}.

If the sound field to be described is a 2D one propagating in the direction parallel to the listening plane, then the surface can be interpreted as a continuous set of infinite vertical line sources along $C$, capable of the perfect description of a 2D field inside the enclosure by a 2D countour integral.}
\label{fig:SFS_theory:TD_Kirchoff_geometry}  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Assume a 3D volume bounded by a surface being invariant along the vertical dimension, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SFS_theory:TD_Kirchoff_geometry}.
An arbitrary non-stationary sound sound field inside the enclosure can be described by the time domain Kirchhoff integral \eqref{eq:theory:KA_td}, written with separated integral variables in this particular geometry.
With a harmonic time dependency the radiated field inside the enclosure reads as
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle
P(\vx,t,\omega_0) \!\! =  \!\!
\oint_{C} \! \int_{z_0} \! \int_{t_0}

\label{Eq:SFS_theory:Kirchhoff_spec_geom_td}
\end{equation}
with the integral variable $\td s$ being the arc length along the contour.
%

With substituting the explicit formula for the time domain 3D Green's function, integration with respect to the boundary emission time $t_0$ can be evaluated by exploiting the Dirac delta sifting property, and the radiated field is given as
\begin{equation}
P(\vx,t,\omega_0) \!\!=\!\! \frac{1}{2\pi}
\oint_{C} \!\! \int_{z_0}  \!\!

\label{Eq:SFS_theory:Kirchhoff_spec_geom_td_2}
\end{equation}
In order to reduce the formulation to a contour integral, the vertical integral is approximated by the stationary phase method.

Generally speaking, in an arbitrary surface geometry the stationary point of the integral is found where the gradient of the integrand's phase function vanishes, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\left. \Dxo \phi^P(\vxo,t-\Tret,\omega_0) \right|_{\vxo = \vxo^*(\vx,t)} = 0
\end{equation} 
holds.
The gradient can be evaluated by taking the total derivative of the phase function, after rearrangement resulting in
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\Dxo \phi^P(\vxo^*(\vx,t),t-\TretS,\omega_0) }{\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\phi^P(\vxo^*(\vx,t),t-\TretS,\omega_0) } = \frac{\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t)}{|\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t)|}
\end{equation}
in the stationary position.
The left-hand side describes the normalized local wavenumber vector of a general non-stationary sound field $P$ \emph{taken at the time instant $t-\Tret$} (c.f. \eqref{eq:Moving_source:local_wn_general}), while the right term is recognized as the normalized local wavenumber vector of the stationary secondary point source. 
Thus, he stationary position for the Kirchhoff integral is found where
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:moving_sources:moving_point_stat_point_1}
\hat{\vk}^P(\vxo^*(\vx,t),t-\TretS) = \hat{\vk}^G(\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t))
\end{equation}
is satisfied.

The result is the generalization of the findings presented in Section \ref{Sec:HS_approx:SPA_for_Rayleigh}, stating the following:
The Kirchhoff integral represents an arbitrary primary sound field at the receiver position $\vx$ as the sum of individual spherical waves emerging from the continuous distribution of point sources along the boundary.
The stationary SSD element for a given receiver position $\vx$, is the secondary source that's wavefront measured at $\vx,t$, emitted at $\vxo^*, t-\TretS$ coincides with the primary wavefront measured at $\vxo^*, t-\TretS$.

Since the secondary and primary wavefronts propagate together along the common propagation direction, this requirement ensures that the stationary boundary element's wavefront and the primary wavefront match at the receiver position $\vx$ at the receiving time instant $t$, thus 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\vk}^P(\vx,t) = \hat{\vk}^G(\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t))
\end{equation}
also holds.

The concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Moving_sources:KI_stat_point} with the example of the stationary point for the field of a moving point source.
For this case, the normalized local wavenumber vector is given by \eqref{eq:Moving_source:norm_local_wn_moving_source} and the stationary position $\vxo^*(\vx,t)$ is found where 
\importanteq{Time domain KI stat. point}{
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:moving_source_stat_point}
\frac{\vxo^*(\vx,t) -\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo^*,t_0))}{|\vxo^*(\vx,t)-\vxs(t_0 - \tau(\vxo^*,t_0))|} =  \frac{\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t)}{|\vx-\vxo^*(\vx,t)|}
}
is satisfied.
Hence, the stationary point is given where the local propagation direction of the spherical wavefront generated by the moving source at $t_0-\tau(\vxo^*,t_0)$ and measured on the boundary at $t_0$ coincides the spherical wavefront of the stationary point source measured at position $\vx$.
Geometrically, this point lies at the intersection of the boundary and the vector pointing from the moving point source at the emission time to the receiver position.

Having found the stationary point for the Kirchhoff integral, the vertical integration can be approximated by the SPA.
Similarly to the stationary case, choosing the plane of investigation to $\vx = \posvec{3}{x}{y}{0}$ fixes the vertical stationary position to lie at $z_0^*(\vx,t) \rightarrow z_0^* = 0$.
This requirement is trivially satisfied by sound sources moving along trajectories fixed to the plane of investigation, therefore, in the following only in-plane source trajectories $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{x_s(t)}{y_s(t)}{0}$ are assumed.

The required second phase derivative around the stationary point are simply given in terms of the source-boundary and boundary-receiver distances, reading
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:MS_second_phase_der}
\left. \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial z_0^2 }\phi^P(\vxo,t-\Tret,\omega_0) \right|_{z_0 = z_0^* = 0} = 
- \frac{\omega(\vxo,t_0)}{c}\left( \frac{1}{|\vxo - \vxs(t_e)|} + \frac{1}{|\vx-\vxo|} \right),
\end{equation} 
with $t_0 = t - \Tret$ being the boundary emission time, $t_e = t - \Tret - \tau(\vxo,t_0)$ the source emission time and $\omega(\vxo,t_0)$ the perceived angular frequency  along the boundary surface, given by \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_per_freq}.
Thus, similarly to the stationary case (c.f. \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:Curvatures_Addition}), the second phase derivative is given by the sum of the vertical curvatures of the primary sound field and the Green's function.

Finally---by taking the negative sign of \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:MS_second_phase_der} into consideration---the stationary phase approximation of the integral \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:Kirchhoff_spec_geom_td_2} yields the \emph{2.5D Kirchhoff integral for a moving source}:
\importantmline{Moving source 2.5D Kirchhoff approx.}{
P(\vx,t,\omega_0) =
\oint_{C} 2 w(\vxo,t_0 ) 
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\ti\frac{\omega(\vxo,t_0)}{c}}}

\label{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source_a}
}
now $\vx = \posvec{3}{x}{y}{0}$ and $\vxo = \posvec{3}{x_0}{y_0}{0}$ denoting in-plane positions.

\subsection{2.5D Wave Field Synthesis of a moving point source}

In order to extract the implicit driving function from the Kirchhoff integral it is exploited that all the time variables in \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source_a} are present with a constant temporal shift $t-\Tret$.
The integral, therefore, can be reformulated in terms of a temporal convolution with the 3D time domain Green's function as
\begin{multline}
P(\vx,t,\omega_0) =
\oint_{C}  \int_{t_0} 2 w(\vxo,t_0 ) 
\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\ti\frac{\omega(\vxo,t_0)}{c}}}
\sqrt{\frac{|\vx-\vxo|\cdot|\vxo - \vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}{|\vx-\vxo|+|\vxo - \vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}} \cdot \\
 \ti k_{\mathrm{n}}^P(\vxo,t_0) P(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0)
\underbrace{\frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{ \delta(t-t_0- \Tret) }{|\vx-\vxo|}}_{g(\vx-\vxo,t-t_0)}
\, \td t_0 \, \td s(x_0, y_0).
\label{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source_2}
\end{multline}
Comparison with the time domain SFS problem \eqref{eq:moving_source:SFS_problem_td} reveals that this formulation implicitly contains the time domain 2.5D WFS driving function for a harmonic moving source, still depending on the receiver position.

The dependency may be resolved by applying the same strategy as for the stationary case:
Under the validity of the horizontal SPA each SSD element of the contour integral dominates the synthesized field at positions for which it serves as a stationary point.
These positions are given by straight lines (rays) passing through the SSD element into the direction of the local wavenumber vector of the virtual field.
Along this line a unique reference point $\vxref(\vxo,t_0)$ can be prescribed for each SSD element, satisfying
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_WFS_ref_point}
\hat{\vk}^P(\vxo,t_0) &= \hat{\vk}^G(\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo),
\\
\frac{\vxo -\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}{|\vxo-\vxs(t_0 - \tau(\vxo,t_0))|} &=  \frac{\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo}{|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo|}.
\end{align}
Geometrically, in the particular case of a moving point source, the reference position lies on the line connecting the SSD element and the source position at the emission time.

By substituting this reference position into the amplitude factor of \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source_2}, the driving function achieving amplitude correct synthesis over the set of all reference positions can be extracted from the contour integral.
The extracted driving function reads as
\importantmline{2.5D WFS moving source harmonic driv. fun.}{
D(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0) \!\! = \!\!
\underbrace{ \sqrt{\frac{2\pi |\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo|}{\ti\frac{\omega(\vxo,t_0)}{c}}}}_{{\substack{\text{SSD}\\\text{compensation}}}}
\underbrace{\sqrt{\frac{|\vxo - \vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}{|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo|+|\vxo - \vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}}}_{{\substack{\text{virtual source}\\\text{compensation}}}} 
\cdot \\
\underbrace{2 w(\vxo,t_0) \ti k_{\mathrm{n}}^P(\vxo,t_0) P(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0)}_{\substack{\text{2D}\\\text{driving function}}},
\label{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source}
}
with $\tau(\vxo,t_0)$ being the propagation time delay from the moving source position at the emission time to the actual SSD position.% having to be evaluated for each SSD position at each time instant.

This driving function is the straightforward generalization of the 2.5D WFS driving function \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_WFS_driv_fun_ver_2} towards non-stationary sound fields, consisting of the ideal 2D WFS driving function along with two dimensionality correction factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item The secondary source correction factor compensates the attenuation and the frequency response of the 2D SSD contour.
Again, the attenuation correction can be optimized only at a predefined distance from each SSD element allowing the referencing of the synthesis on a prescribed reference curve.
The frequency correction term compensates for the half-integrator nature of 2D SSD which along with the differentiation in the 2D driving function would result in enhanced high-pass characteristics.
The correction is performed by the instantaneous perceived angular frequency altered by the Doppler shift, as measured along the SSD.
\item The virtual source correction factor corrects the synthesized field amplitude at the receiver position from a 2D to a 3D one.
As it was expressed by \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:attenuation} and \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:attenuation_2}, regardless of the instantaneous spatial amplitude distribution (which is altered by the Doppler factor), a 3D wavefront attenuates inversely proportional to its mean curvature along its propagation path.
For the particular case of a moving point source: the emitted wavefront attenuates inversely proportionally with the distance from the source at the emission time and the point of investigation.
Hence, the virtual source compensation factor matches the amplitude factor of the \emph{synthesized wavefront} to the \emph{target wavefront} by taking the wavefront propagation dynamics into consideration.
\end{itemize}
Similarly to the stationary case, referencing the synthesis can be performed by prescribing an arbitrary, time-invariant reference curve $\vxref$ and expressing the SSD and virtual source compensation factors so that the reference positions for each SSD element $\vxref(\vxo,t_0)$ lie along the reference curve and satisfy \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_WFS_ref_point}.

The diving function \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source} allows the synthesis of a moving source radiating on a single source frequency component.
For a wideband excitation with the frequency content $S(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t) \te^{-\ti \omega t} \td t$, the driving function is obtained by summing the individual spectral components, resulting in a temporal inverse Fourier integral.
The perceived frequency $\omega(\vx,t)$ is expressed in terms of the source's angular frequency $\omega_0$ according to \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_per_freq}.%

The integral can be recognized as the inverse Fourier transform of the pre-filtered source time history taken at $t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 )$.
Similarly to the stationary case, the source signal is pre-equalized with a half-differentiator filter with the transfer function described by $H(\omega) = \sqrt{\ti \omega}$, compensating for the 2D SSD contour frequency response.
Finally, the time domain driving function for the synthesis of a moving point source with a wideband excitation signal reads as

where the prefiltered input signal is given by $ s^{\nshortmid}_t(t) = h(t) \ast_{t} s(t)$ with the pre-equalization filter's impulse response given by $h(t) = \IFT[\omega]{ \sqrt{\ti \omega} }$.
Note that unlike for the stationary case, here the order of pre-filtering and delaying of the excitation signal is not interchangeable.

The driving function allows the synthesis of a source under motion with an arbitrary source trajectory and velocity profile with applying an arbitrary SSD contour and ensuring optimized synthesis on an arbitrary shaped reference contour.
The synthesis in such a general scenario is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:SFS_theory:25D_WFS_moving_source} illustrating the reproduction of a source, moving along a straight trajectory.

The calculation of the driving function requires the knowledge of the emission time for each SSD element at each time instant.
Furthermore, in this dynamic case, due to the source motion the reference position for an arbitrary SSD element varies with time, thus, $\vxref(\vxo,t_0)$ has to be found for each SSD element at each time instant.
Therefore, the evaluation of the general driving functions is of a great computational complexity.
In a Section \ref{Sec:Trajectory_calc} it is discussed how these computational expensive problems can be solved numerically.
For more simple trajectories and synthesis geometries the required quantities are available analytically.
Such a simple synthesis scenario is discussed in the following.

\subsection*{Application example: Synthesis of a uniformly moving source applying a linear SSD}

Now the reproduction of a point source under uniform motion is investigated by applying a linear SSD and optimizing the synthesis on a parallel reference line.
The importance of the example lies in the fact that for this geometry the analytical explicit solution is also known---presented in the following section---allowing the direct comparison of the implicit and explicit methodologies for this non-stationary scenario.

For the sake of simplicity, the source is chosen to move uniformly along the $x$-axis with a trajectory given by $\vxs = \posvec{3}{x_s + v\cdot t}{y_s}{0}$, oscillating at the angular frequency $\omega_0$.
The infinite linear SSD is located at $\vxo = \posvec{3}{x_0}{0}{0}$ and the reference line is set to $\vxref = \posvec{3}{x}{\yref}{0}$.
For this geometry the windowing function is identically $w(\vx,t_0) \equiv 1$ and the driving function from \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source} reads as
\begin{multline}
D(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0) \!\! = \!\!
\sqrt{\frac{8\pi }{\ti\frac{\omega_0}{c}}} 
\resizebox{0.45\hsize}{!}{$ \sqrt{\frac{|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo| \cdot \Delta(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}{|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo|+|\vxo - \vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}} $}
\ti k_y^P(\vxo,t_0) P(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0).
\end{multline}
The reference distance $|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo|$ can be expressed by the definition of the stationary position \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_WFS_ref_point} written merely for the $y$-coordinates
\begin{equation}
%\hat{\vk}^P(\vxo,t_0) &= \hat{\vk}^G(\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo)
%\\
|\vxref(\vxo,t_0)-\vxo| =  -\frac{\yref}{y_s(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}|\vxo-\vxs(t_0 - \tau(\vxo,t_0))|.
%\end{align}
\end{equation}
%and the referencing function reads as
%\begin{equation}
%\dref(\vxo,t_0) = \sqrt{ \Delta(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))\frac{ \yref }{\yref-y_s(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))}}.
%\end{equation}
Finally, expressing the radiated field and its local wavenumber vector explicitly and exploiting that $y_s$ is constant yields the driving function
\begin{equation}
D(\vxo,t_0,\omega_0) = -
\sqrt{\frac{ \ti k_0}{2\pi} }
\sqrt{\frac{ \yref }{\yref-y_s}}
y_s
\frac{\te^{\ti \omega_0\left( t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 )\right)}}{\Delta(\vxo,t_0)^{\frac{3}{2}}},
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:25D_WFS_linear_ssd}
\end{equation}
with the propagation time delay and the attenuation factor given by \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:tau_uniform} and \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:delta_uniform}, respectively.
%\begin{equation}
%\tau(\vxo,t_0) = \frac{M (x_0 - v t_0 - x_s )+\Delta(\vxo,t_0)}{c (1-M^2)} 
%\end{equation}
%and the amplitude distribution
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta(\vxo,t_0) = \sqrt{(x_0 - v t_0 - x_s)^2 + y_s^2(1-M^2)}.
%\end{equation}
The time domain driving function for a source excitation time history of $s(t)$ is given by the inverse Fourier transform of \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:25D_WFS_linear_ssd} with respect to $\omega_0$, reading 
\begin{equation}
d(\vxo,t_0) = -
\sqrt{\frac{ 1 }{2\pi c} }
\sqrt{\frac{ \yref }{\yref-y_s}}
y_s
\frac{s^{\nshortmid}_t(t_0 - \tau( \vxo,t_0 ))}{\Delta(\vxo,t_0)^{\frac{3}{2}}},
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:25D_WFS_linear_ssd_td}
\end{equation}
where $s^{\nshortmid}_t(t) = h(t) \ast_{t} s(t)$, with $h(t) = \IFT[\omega]{ \sqrt{\ti \omega} }$.

\end{figure}
The result of synthesis is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:25D_WFS_linear_ssd}, verifying that the presented driving function optimizes the synthesis along the reference line.
Comparison with \eqref{eq:SFS_theory:WFS_point_source} reveals that the moving source driving function formally coincides with the traditional WFS driving function for a stationary point source \cite[(2.27)]{Verheijen1997:phd}, \cite[(3.16)\&(3.17)]{Start1997:phd} with the stationary distances, delays and amplitude factor changed for the corresponding dynamic variables.

The above driving function can be easily extended for sources moving inclined to the SSD with the substitution of a space-time dependent source position $y_s \rightarrow y_s(t_0 - \tau(\vxo,t_0))$, as it is discussed in details in \cite{firtha2016wave}.
In this case, however, the moving source crosses the theoretically infinite SSD resulting in singular driving function at the time instant of the crossing and converging virtual wavefronts afterwards.
The synthesis of this type of focused moving sources is not investigated in the present thesis.

\section{Explicit solution for the synthesis of moving sources}

So far only the time domain and a mixed time-frequency domain representations of moving sources were discussed, applied directly for the WFS of sources under motion.
For the special case of sources under uniform motion, the frequency domain and wavenumber domain representations of the radiated sound field can be expressed analytically.
The presented wavenumber representations afterwards can be used in order to arrive at explicit driving function for the synthesis of a moving source.

\subsection{Spectral representation  of moving sources}

Assume a harmonic source moving along a straight trajectory parallel with the $x$-axis (i.e. the source position time history is given by $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{x_s + v \cdot t}{0}{0}$), radiating with a wideband excitation time history $s(t)$.
Following \eqref{eq:moving_source:non_stat_convolution}, the radiated field can be written in the form of a convolution of the source signal and the retarded Green's function $g_{\mathrm{m}}$, reading
\begin{equation}
p_{\mathrm{m}}(\vx,t) = \int_{\tE} g_{\mathrm{m}}(x - x_s-v\cdot\tE ,y,z,t-\tE) \, s(\tE) \, \td \tE,
\end{equation}
with $t_e$ being the emission time.
Comparison with \eqref{Eq:App:Non_stat_conv_td} reveals that the radiated field is written in terms of a non-stationary convolution, for which the spectral representation is known, given by \eqref{Eq:App:Non_stat_conv_fd}.
By applying the Fourier shift theorem (shifting by a factor of $x-x_s$) and the scaling theorem (rescaling by $v$) to \eqref{Eq:App:Non_stat_conv_fd} the spectrum of the radiated field is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathbf{x},\omega) = \frac{1}{v} 
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S(\omega_0) \,
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y, z, \omega) \,
\te^{-\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} \left(x-x_s\right)}  \, \td \omega_0.
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:Freq_domain_representation_wb_excit}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{figure}

    \caption{The time history and spectrum of a harmonic source moving on a trajectory $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{v\cdot t}{-2}{0}$ with $v = \frac{c}{2}$, oscillating at $f_0$.
    The pass-by is measured in the origin.
    The spectrum is described by the Hankel function, as given by \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:Freq_domain_representation}.
    The poles/singularities of the spectrum are termed as the \emph{dominant frequencies} of the approaching ($t \rightarrow -\infty$) and the diverging ($t \rightarrow \infty$), given from \eqref{eq:HF_appr:moving_s_per_freq} as $\omega_d = \omega_0 \frac{1}{1 \pm M}$, with $M = \frac{v}{c}$ being the Mach number.
    }
\label{fig:Moving_sources:moving_source_field_spectrum}  
\end{figure}
%
Hence, the radiated field in the spectral domain is obtained by a non-stationary convolution as well.
Since integration is performed over the frequency content of the source input signal $S(\omega_0)$, the kernel of the convolution can be recognized as the frequency content of a moving source pass-by, radiating at a single frequency component $\omega_0$.
The field of a harmonic moving source is, therefore, given by
\importanteq{Moving source in $\vx-\omega$ domain}{
P_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathbf{x},\omega,\omega_0) =
\frac{1}{v}
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y, z, \omega) \,

\label{Eq:Moving_sources:Freq_domain_representation}
}
with the Green's function's wavenumber content given in Table \ref{tab:theory:Greens_fun_representations} as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y, z, \omega) = -\frac{\ti}{4} H_0^{(2)} \left( \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2 - \left( \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} \right)^2} y \right).
\end{equation}
The equation states that the frequency domain representation of a moving point source pass-by at a given receiver point is completely described by its 1D spatio-temporal spectrum $\tilde{G}(k_x,y,z,\omega)$ with the substitution $k_x \rightarrow \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}$.
This is the immediate consequence of the fact that in the present geometry the time history of the measured pass-by is invariant along the $x$-axis up to a constant time delay. 
%
The time history of a uniformly moving source pass-by and the corresponding angular spectrum are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:moving_source_field_spectrum}.

\end{figure}

\vspace{3mm}
Due to the spatio-temporal invariance of the spectrum \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:Freq_domain_representation} along the $x$-dimension, the spatial Fourier transform is straightforward, yielding

The angular spectrum representation (i.e. $k_x-y-k_z$ representation) is given as

  \, \delta(k_x - \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}).
\label{Eq:Moving_sources:MS_field_kx_kz}
}
Note that the representation does not pose any constraint on the actual form of the Green's function: The above equations theoretically describe the field of an arbitrary source under uniform motion.	

The $k_x-\omega$ domain representation of the field of a harmonic stationary and moving source is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:moving_source_kxw} (a) and (b), respectively.
In both cases the amplitude distribution of the spectra are described by the wavenumber content of the Green's function, given by $\tilde{G}(k_x,y,z,\omega)$.
It is illustrated that bringing a sound source into uniform motion will result in the rotation of its spectrum around $k_x = 0$ and rescaling in order to fill the propagation region.
The amount of rotation is given directly by the source velocity (the angle of rotation is $\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{v}{c}$).

The above spectral formulations can be extended for sources moving inclined to the $x$-axis, as given in Appendix \ref{App:Moving_source_representations}.
These formulations may be applied for deriving implicit and explicit driving functions for virtual sources moving uniformly along arbitrary directed straight trajectories, as it is discussed in details in \cite{firtha2015sound}.
Since, however, the previous section presented a more general methodology for the reproduction of sources under arbitrary motion, it is sufficient to restrict the investigation of the explicit SFS methodology for sources moving parallel with the $x$-axis, resulting in closed form analytic formulations.

\subsection{3D Spectral Division Method for moving sources}

The spectral representations given in the foregoing allows the derivation of explicit SFS driving function for the synthesis of moving sources.
The following driving functions are specialized to the case of sources under uniform motion, reproduced by planar and linear SSDs in contrary to WFS, allowing the reproduction of moving sources in a general geometry.
Still, the importance of the explicit solution is that it constitutes a reference solution for the dynamic synthesis problem and allows the investigation of aliasing artifacts in the following.

Assuming an infinite planar distribution of secondary sources along the plane $\vxo = \posvec{3}{x_0}{0}{z_0}$, the explicit driving function in the $k_x-k_z$ domain is obtained by substituting given the angular spectrum representation of the moving harmonic source field \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:MS_field_kx_kz} into the general 3D explicit driving function \eqref{Eq:Theory:Planar_explicit_driv_fun}
\begin{equation}
D(k_x,k_z,\omega,\omega_0) = \frac{2 \pi }{v} \frac{
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y-y_s, k_z, \omega)
}{ \tilde{G}(k_x, y, k_z, \omega) } \,
\te^{\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} x_s} \,
 \delta(k_x - \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}).
\end{equation}
The spatial driving function is obtained from the double inverse Fourier transform of the wavenumber domain driving function.
Integration along $k_x$ can be evaluated analytically with the Dirac delta sifting out $k_x = \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}$.
In the spatial domain the driving function takes the form
\begin{equation}
D(x_0,z_0,\omega, \omega_0) = 
\frac{1}{2\pi}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\frac{1}{v} \frac{
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y-y_s, k_z, \omega)
}{ \tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, y, k_z, \omega) } 
\, \te^{-\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} (x_0-x_s)} 
\, \te^{-\ti k_z z_0}
\, \td k_z.
\end{equation}
Substituting the explicit formula for the 3D Green's function's angular spectrum representation given by Table \ref{tab:theory:Greens_fun_representations} allows simplification by $\sqrt{\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}\right)^2 - k_z^2}$ and the division of the exponentials, making the driving function independent from the $y$-coordinate.
\begin{equation}
D(x_0,z_0,\omega,\omega_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{v} \cdot \!\!\!\!
\underbrace{\te^{-\ti \sqrt{\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 -  \left(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}\right)^2 - k_z^2} |y_s|}}_
{-2 \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left. \frac{\te^{-\ti \sqrt{\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 -  \left(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}\right)^2 - k_z^2} |y-y_s|}}{-\ti \sqrt{\left( \frac{\omega}{c} \right)^2 -  \left(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}\right)^2 - k_z^2}} \right|_{y=0} }
\!\!\!\! \cdot \te^{-\ti k_z z_0} \, \td k_z \,
 \te^{-\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} (x_0-x_s) }.
\end{equation}
The integral can be recognized as the inverse spatial Fourier transform of the $y$-derivative of the Green's function taken on the SSD (cf. Table \ref{tab:theory:Greens_fun_representations}).

with $\tau(\vxo,t_0)$ and $\Delta(\vxo,t_0)$ given by \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:tau_uniform} and \eqref{fig:Moving_sources:delta_uniform}, respectively.
%

The result of synthesis applying the above driving function is depicted in Figure \ref{Fig:Moving_sources:moving_synthesis_by_planar_SDM}, verifying that by applying an infinite planar SSD perfect synthesis can be achieved in front of the SSD.
Obviously, in this SSD geometry the explicit driving function coincides with the implicit solution without applying the high frequency gradient approximation.

\subsection{2.5D Spectral Division Method for moving sources}

By applying the wavenumber domain description of a uniformly moving source, the explicit driving function for an infinite linear SSD may be obtained.
As discussed in the foregoing, the application of a linear SSD allows the synthesis of a source distribution located at the plane of the SSD and the reference line, hence, in the following the investigation is fixed to the plane of synthesis, $z=0$.

As the simplest case the virtual source moves parallel with the SSD with the source position given by $\vxs(t) = \posvec{3}{v\cdot t}{y_s}{0}$ with $y_s<0$, oscillating at $\omega_0$. 
The SSD is a linear set of 3D point sources, located along $\vxo = \posvec{3}{x_0}{0}{0}$.
The general 2.5D explicit driving function for a linear SSD is given by \eqref{Eq:SFS_Theory:LinearSDM_spectral}. 
In the present case the required wavenumber content of the virtual field is given by \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:MS_field_kx_z}.
With substituting this formulation, the wavenumber domain driving function optimizing the synthesis on a reference line $\yref$ parallel with the SSD is expressed as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{D}(k_x,\omega,\omega_0) = 
\frac{2\pi}{v}
\frac{ 
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, \yref-y_s, 0, \omega)
}{\tilde{G}(k_x,\yref,0, \omega)} \,
 \delta(k_x - \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}) \, 
\te^{\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} x_s}.
\label{Eq:Moving_source:kx_driv_fun}
\end{equation}
The spatial representation of the driving function is obtained by a spatial inverse Fourier transform of the above expression.
Unlike in the stationary case, due to the spatial invariancy of the virtual source field (up to a phase shift) the inverse transform may be evaluated analytically. 
By exploiting the Dirac delta sifting property the spatial inverse Fourier transform results in 
\begin{equation}
D(x_0,\omega,\omega_0) = 
\frac{1}{v}
\frac{ 
\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v}, \yref-y_s, 0, \omega)
}{\tilde{G}(\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v},\yref,0, \omega)}
\te^{-\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} (x_0 - x_s)}.
\end{equation}
Expressing $\tilde{G}(k_x,y,0,\omega)$ yields the final 2.5D SDM driving function
\importanteq{2.5D SDM driving function}{
\label{Eq:moving_source_25D_SDM}
D(x_0,\omega,\omega_0) =

}
%For a moving source with wideband excitation signal $s(t)$ the explicit driving function reads as

%\frac{1}{2 \pi v}
%\int_{\infty}^{\infty} S(\omega_0)

The result of synthesis applying the explicit driving function in case of a harmonic moving source is depicted in Figure \eqref{Fig:Moving_sources:moving_synthesis_by_linear_SDM}.
It is verified that the explicit method theoretically ensures perfect synthesis along the reference line, therefore, it may serve as a reference solution.

Under high frequency conditions the Hankel function can be approximated by its asymptotic expansion, as it is given by \eqref{Eq:HF_approx:Hankel_asymptotic_form}.
Substituting this approximate formulation into \eqref{Eq:moving_source_25D_SDM}, the spectral division can be carried out analytically, resulting in the approximate driving function

\, \te^{-\ti \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} (x_0 - x_s)}.
}
This formulation coincides with the implicit Wave Field Synthesis driving function for a moving source, derived entirely in the spectral domain: 
The frequency domain representation of a moving source \eqref{Eq:Moving_sources:Freq_domain_representation} allows an alternative derivation of the 2.5D WFS driving function by applying the stationary phase approximation entirely in the frequency domain.
The approach---described in details in \cite{firtha2015sound}---is not discussed here further, since it is superseded by the time domain WFS formulation introduced in the foregoing in Section \ref{Sec:Moving_source_WFS}.
The coincidence of the driving functions, however, indicates that Wave Field Synthesis is a high frequency/wavefront matching approximation of the explicit solution, proven for a general stationary sound field in the previous chapter.

\section{Practical aspects of the synthesis of moving sources}

So far the theoretical foundations of physically correct synthesis of source movements were discussed.
The practical implementation of the foregoing raises numerous questions.
Several quantities are present in the driving function that are assumed to be known a-priori, however, their definition is not straightforward and is computationally expensive, making real-time applications impossible.
Furthermore, the choice of the SSD shape, the applied referencing scheme and the applied anti-aliasing strategy is crucial in the aspect of synthesizing dynamic sound scenes.
The following section presents several practical considerations and solutions for the challenges arising at the synthesis of a moving point source, as discussed in  \cite{Firtha2018_daga_moving_source}.

\subsection{Calculation of source trajectory}
\label{Sec:Trajectory_calc}

The direct implementation of the moving source driving function \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:25D_KI_moving_source} assumes that the time dependent source position $\vxs(t)$ is known a-priori. 
This is an optimistic assumption in the aspect of practical applicability. 
Instead, more often a parametric curve $\mathbf{y}(u)$ is given which the virtual source follows with a pre-defined velocity profile.
This requirement can be formulated as finding a reparameterization so that 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y}(u(t)) = \vxs(t), \hspace{6mm} \left| \frac{\td \vxs(t)}{\td t} \right| = |\vvs(t)| 
\label{Eq:parametric_curves}
\end{equation}
holds. 
The goal is to find the explicit parametrization $u(t)$ so that substitution into \eqref{Eq:parametric_curves} yields the desired source position vector.

Differentiation of \eqref{Eq:parametric_curves} with respect to time and applying the chain rule for $\td u / \td t$ results in
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\td u(t) }{\td t} = \frac{|\vvs(t)|}{\left| \td \mathbf{y}(u(t)) / \td u \right|},
\end{equation}
if $u(t)$ is assumed to be monotonically increasing.
In order to express $u(t)$, both sides are multiplied by $\td t$ and---according the first fundamental theorem of calculus---taking the definite integral leads to
\begin{equation}
u(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \frac{|\vvs(s)|}{\left| \td \mathbf{y}(u(s)) / \td u \right|} \td s,
\label{Eq:pt}
\end{equation}
with $t_0$ being a user-defined initial time.
Note that for sources moving with constant velocity ($|\vvs(s)| = v$) the parametrization is referred to as reparametrization to arc length.

For an arbitrary trajectory and velocity profile, the parametrization \eqref{Eq:pt} can be evaluated only numerically.
A detailed discussion on the frequently used numerical methods can be found in \cite{Parent2012}.
As a simple approach, the integral may be approximated numerically with the forward-Euler method, approximating the integral with the iteration scheme
\importanteq{Trajectory parametrization}{
u_{i+1} = u_i + \td t \frac{|\vvs(u_i)|}{ | \td \mathbf{y}(u_i)/\td u | }, \hspace{10mm} i \geq 0,
}
where $\td t = \frac{1}{fs}$ is the sampling period of the source trajectory.
Once the parametrization $u_i$ is found, the required source trajectory vector at the time instant $t_i$ can be obtained from $\vxs(t_i) = \mathbf{y}(u_i)$. 

\subsection{Calculation of propagation time delay}
	
Having found the source trajectory, the implementation of the driving function would still require the knowledge of the propagation time delay, i.e. the time it takes for the wavefront to travel from the source position at the emission time to the receiver position at the receiving time.
This requires the solution of the quadratic equation \eqref{eq:tau} for each SSD element at each time instant, making real-time implementation infeasible.

The computational complexity may be considerably decreased by implementing a further Euler iteration scheme, i.e. by approximating $\tau(\vx,t)$ by its first order Taylor series
\begin{equation}
\tau(\vx,t+\td t) \approx \tau(\vx,t) + \td t \, \frac{\partial \tau(\vx,t)}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}
The temporal derivative of $\tau$ can be obtained from the implicit differentiation of its definition \eqref{eq:tau}, reading as
\importanteq{$\tau$ derivative}{
\frac{\partial \tau(\vx,t)}{\partial t} = \tau'_t(\vx,t) = \frac{-\frac{1}{c} \left< \vvs(t-\tau) \cdot ( \vx-\vxs(t-\tau) ) \right>}{| \vx - \vxs(t) |}.
}
Hence, the iteration scheme at the time instant $t_i$ becomes
\importanteq{$\tau$ iteration scheme}{
\tau(\vx,t_i) = \tau(\vx,t_{i-1}) + \td t \cdot \tau'_t(\vx,t_{i-1}),
}
with $\td t = \frac{1}{f_s}$ being the sampling period of the driving function \cite{doi:10.1121/1.4996126}.
Obviously, if the trajectory is available only numerically, $\vxs(t-\tau)$ may be interpolated from the trajectory vector from which the source velocity $\vvs(t-\tau)$ may be calculated by numerical differentiation with respect to time.

It is important to note that the sampling frequency for the calculation of the source trajectory and propagation time delay may be chosen significantly lower than the actual driving signal sampling frequency.
As a result, computational cost can be decreased, besides still ensuring numerical stability.

\subsection{Effects of the SSD discretization}

\paragraph{Description of spatial aliasing}

In the following, the effects of the SSD discretization is discussed in case of synthesizing a moving source, extending the anti-aliasing strategy presented in Section \ref{Sec:Aliasing} to non-stationary sound fields.

The effects of the SSD discretization is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_source:MS_spatial_alising} in case of a moving source with a harmonic (a) or a wideband (b) excitation signal.
Similarly to the stationary case, above a certain frequency the resultant field of the secondary sources does not form a smooth wavefront but the individual wavefronts of the secondary sources create an interference pattern.
In the time domain, spatial aliasing manifests in spherical wavefronts emerging from the individual secondary sources, following the intended virtual wavefront.
These secondary wavefronts are high-pass filtered to the spatial aliasing frequency.

In case of a moving point source the local perceived frequency is altered by the Doppler effect, influencing also the spatial aliasing artifacts.
Those SSD positions where the perceived frequency is locally increased (i.e. in front of the moving source) contribute dominantly to aliasing, while behind the virtual source aliasing waves are less emphasized.
This can be examined in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_source:MS_spatial_alising} (a): 
In case of a moving harmonic source aliasing waves originate from in front of the moving source, radiating laterally backwards at the angular frequency of the local perceived frequency measured at the aliasing SSD element.
This, however, means that aliasing waves arrive to a given receiver point with a frequency, differing from the target local perceived frequency.
In the time domain this means that aliasing wavefronts following the virtual wavefront suffer a different Doppler shift than the intended wavefront.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_source:MS_spatial_alising} (b).
As a result, spatial aliasing artifacts are enhanced compared to the stationary case: 
While for the stationary case aliasing results in the coloration of the synthesized field, for the dynamic case undesired frequency components will be also present in the synthesized sound, being are clearly audible in case of high virtual source velocities.

\label{fig:Moving_source:MS_spatial_alising}  
\end{figure}
\vspace{3mm}
The following section discusses the analysis and mitigation of spatial aliasing artifacts.
Again, it is exploited that WFS constitutes a high frequency approximation for the explicit solution, and the latter allows the analytical description of spatial aliasing.
Hence, the effects of discretization is introduced via the example of the synthesis applying a linear SSD for which the explicit solution is known. 
Afterwards, the findings are generalized towards arbitrary SSDs.

Assume the synthesis of a moving source by applying a discrete, linear SSD located at $\vxo = \posvec{3}{x_0}{0}{0}$ with the loudspeaker spacing being $\Delta x$.
The source moves uniformly along a straight trajectory parallel with the SSD.
The effect of the SSD discretization can be described as the sampling of the ideal continuous driving function, resulting in the repetition of the driving function spectra on the multiples of the sampling wavenumber. 
According to \eqref{Eq:SFS_theory:Aliased_field_sp} the synthesized field reads as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}(k_x,y,z,\omega) = \frac{1}{\Delta x}
\sum_{\eta = -\infty}^{\infty} \tilde{D}\left(k_x - \eta \frac{2\pi}{\Delta x},\omega \right)  \, \tilde{G}(k_x,y,z, \omega),
\label{Eq:Moving_source:Synth_field}
\end{equation}
where the driving function spectrum is given by \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:kx_driv_fun} for the special case of a harmonic source signal.
For a wideband excitation the driving function is obtained as the spectral integral of the harmonic driving function w.r.t $\omega_0$, weighted by the source excitation frequency content.

    Figure (b) shows the spectrum of the 3D Green's function and Figure (c) shows the spectrum of the synthesized field, both measured along the reference line.}
\label{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectrum}
\end{figure}
The process of the synthesis of a moving source with wideband excitation applying a discrete SSD is illustrated in the wavenumber domain in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectrum}.

The spectrum of the moving source driving function is obtained by the rotation and rescaling of the stationary driving function spectrum.
It is illustrated by \ref{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectrum} (a) that in front of the moving source due to the local increase of perceived angular frequency the mirror spectra are more likely to alias: 
In the current example in front of the moving source even a second order aliasing component is present (i.e. $\eta = 2$ component overlaps to the baseband propagation region), while behind the source due to the local decrease of the perceived frequency no aliasing component is present at all (i.e. from these parts of the SSD no aliasing echoes originate).

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Wavenumber-frequency representation of the synthesized field of a harmonic moving source, applying a linear SSD (a) and the corresponding spectogram (b).

\label{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectogram}  
\end{figure}

Investigation of the aliased spectrum of the synthesized field in case of a harmonic source excitation suggests that aliasing components are present in the radiated wavefield with a reversed $k_x$ sign: aliasing waves propagate into the opposite direction the the intended wavefront.
As a direct consequence, in a fixed receiver position aliasing wave emerging from in front of the moving source are perceived after the virtual source pass-by, resulting in strong frequency distortion, as it has been reported and investigated in numerous previous studies \cite{Franck2007, Ahrens2012}.
The phenomenon is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectogram}, depicting the $k_x-\omega$ representation of the synthesized field (a) and the corresponding spectogram (b):
As a result of the SSD discretization, after the virtual source pass-by aliasing waves with an undesired frequency component are present propagating laterally backwards with the frequency determined by the local perceived frequency at the aliasing SSD positions.
With increasing source frequency (or at larger SSD sampling distances) also higher order aliasing components are present in the radiated field, resulting in multiple undesired frequency components. 
Furthermore, if the perceived frequency behind the virtual source increases above the aliasing frequency, undesired frequency components are present before the virtual source pass-by as well.

For the case of a harmonic moving source, the frequency content of the synthesized field can be expressed analytically.
Substituting the 2.5D SDM driving function \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:kx_driv_fun} into \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:Synth_field} and evaluating its spatial inverse Fourier transform by exploiting the sifting property of the Dirac delta results in
\begin{equation}
P(x,y,z,\omega) = 
D(x,\omega,\omega_0) \cdot
\sum_{\eta = -\infty}^{\infty}
\tilde{G}( \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} +  \eta \frac{2\pi}{\Delta x},y,z, \omega )
\, \te^{-\ti  \eta \frac{2\pi}{\Delta x}  x}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\eta = 0$ yields the unaltered, ideal synthesized field without aliasing.
This formulation allows the analytical description of the undesired frequency components: 
Mathematically, the undesired frequency components are stemming from the poles of the translated Green's function $\tilde{G}( \frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} +  \eta \frac{2\pi}{\Delta x},y,z, \omega )$, located where $|\frac{\omega-\omega_0}{v} +  \eta \frac{2\pi}{\Delta x}| = |\frac{v}{c}| = |M|$ holds.
Therefore, the frequency of the aliasing waves before and after the virtual source pass-by is given by
\begin{equation}
\omega = \frac{1}{1 \pm M} \left( \omega_0 + \eta \frac{2\pi v}{\Delta x} \right),
\end{equation}
with for $\eta > 0$ taking the lower and for $\eta < 0$ taking the higher frequency value into consideration.
A more detailed treatise on these undesired frequency components can be found in \cite{firtha2016:daga}.

\paragraph{Avoiding spectral overlapping}
In the foregoing it was highlighted that spatial aliasing may result in audible artifacts due the different Doppler shifts between the intended and the aliasing wavefronts.
Hence, proper anti-aliasing strategy is crucial in the aspect of synthesizing moving sources.
As a first step, the proper choice of the SSD shape is an important question: 
The strong contribution of the undesired frequency components is the result of the theoretically infinite linear SSD with strong contribution of lateral waves.
In the aspect of avoiding aliasing, a smooth, enclosing SSD shape should be chosen at which the virtual wavefront arrives dominantly with the normal local propagation direction.
The optimal choice fulfilling this requirement for an arbitrary source trajectory (and due to further reasons, explained in the following) is applying a circular SSD.

In order to avoid further aliasing artifacts, the same anti-aliasing filtering strategy may be applied as given for a stationary virtual field in Section \ref{Sec:Aliasing}.
From investigating Figure \ref{fig:Moving_sources:Aliased_spectrum} it is clear that by spatial bandlimiting the linear driving function to the Nyquist wavenumber $k_{x,\mathrm{Nyq}} = \frac{\pi}{\Delta x}$, i.e. as long as 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{D}(k_x,\omega) = 0, \hspace{3mm} \text{for} \hspace{3mm}  |k_x| > \frac{\pi}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
holds, the spectral overlapping after discretization could be entirely avoided.
Similarly to the stationary case, the spectrum of the linear driving function at a given wavenumber component $k_x$ and at a given frequency $\omega$ is dominated by that part of the SSD where $k_x^P(\vxo,t) = k_x$ and $\omega(\vxo,t) = \omega$ is satisfied, with $\omega(\vxo,t)$ being the perceived, Doppler shifted angular frequency.
Since the two quantities are related by the local dispersion relation \eqref{eq:Moving_source:local_wn_general}, in the spatial domain the anti-aliasing condition can be formulated as
\begin{equation}
D(x_0,\omega) = 0, \hspace{3mm} \text{for} \hspace{3mm}  k_x^P(\vxo,t_0) = \frac{\omega(\vxo,t_0)}{c} \cdot |\hat{k}_x^P(\vxo,t_0)|  > \frac{\pi}{\Delta x},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{k}_x^P(\vxo,t_0)$ is the $x$-component of the normalized local wavenumber vector.
Finally, within the validity of the Kirchhoff approximation an arbitrary smooth SSD can be considered locally linear.
In this general case, the above anti-aliasing criterion holds with the role of $k_x^P$ interchanged to the tangential wavenumber component $k_t^P$, resulting in 
\begin{equation}
D(\vxo,\omega) = 0, \hspace{3mm} \text{for} \hspace{3mm} \omega(\vxo,t_0) > \frac{\pi}{\Delta x} \frac{c}{|\hat{k}_t^P(\vxo,t_0)|}.
\end{equation}
According to \eqref{eq:Moving_source:norm_local_wn_moving_source}, for a moving source the normalized local wavenumber vector is a unit vector pointing into the receiver position from the source position at the emission time.
Denoting the tangent vector of the secondary sources by $\mathbf{t}(\vxo)$ this leads to the final anti-aliasing condition for a moving point source:
\importanteq{Moving source anti-aliasing condition}{
D(\vxo,\omega) = 0, \hspace{3mm} \text{for} \hspace{3mm} \omega(\vxo,t_0) > \frac{\pi c}{\Delta x} \frac{|\vxo-\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0))|}
{|\left< \vxo-\vxs(t_0-\tau(\vxo,t_0)) \cdot \mathbf{t}(\vxo) \right>|}.
\label{Eq:Moving_source:anti-aliasing_cutoff_freq}
}
This means that anti-aliasing requires the implementation of a time variant low-pass filter with the cut-off frequency given above analytically.

    Figure (a) shows the effects of source discretization with clearly visible aliasing echoes.

	\label{Fig:Moving_sources:anti-aliased_synth_moving_source}
\end{figure}

Similarly to the stationary case, full-band synthesis is achieved only on those parts of the synthesized field for which the stationary SSD element's normal vector coincides with the local propagation direction of the virtual field.
At that position the denominator of \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:anti-aliasing_cutoff_freq} vanishes and the cut-off frequency is $\omega(\vxo,t_0) = \infty$.

For the special case of a circular SSD, the normal vector always points towards the center of the array.
Hence, the SSD geometry inherently ensures that at the center of the array a nearly full-band stationary SSD element exists.
This is, again, an important advantage of circular loudspeaker arrays.
Terminology nearly full-band synthesis refers to the fact that due to the discretization of the SSD, full-band synthesis is only possible when at the stationary SSD position an actual SSD element is located.
In practice, when the moving source is located between two actual secondary sources, even at the center of the array the synthesized field is slightly bandlimited (depending on the distance of the virtual source from the SSD).
This may cause audible artifacts if the source is close to the SSD.

The result of the proposed anti-aliasing approach with applying a circular SSD is illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Moving_sources:anti-aliased_synth_moving_source}.
In the simulation the source is traveling along a general curved trajectory defined by a discrete set of points from which the trajectory and the propagation time delay was calculated iteratively, as it was discussed in the previous subsections.
The simulation results verify the nearly full-band synthesis in the center of the secondary array.

\subsection{Choosing the referencing scheme}
The evaluation of the 2.5D WFS driving function given by \eqref{Eq:Moving_source:25D_WFS} requires the definition of a reference position $\vxref(\vxo,t_0)$ for each SSD element at each time instant.
In case of a moving virtual source, this reference point is found for a given time instant at the intersection of the reference curve and the line passing through the actual SSD element and the source position at the corresponding emission time.
Obviously, the direct solution for the reference position is of great computational cost, making real-time applications infeasible. 
Therefore, geometries with analytical solutions are preferred.

As a possible solution, simple reference curve and SSD shapes may be used for which the analytical solution for the reference position is available.
As an example, in case of a circular SSDs the choice of a concentric circle for the reference curve seems to be feasible for which geometry the intersection of a parametric line and a circle is well-known \cite[Ch.7.3.2]{Schneider2003:ComputerGraphics}.
The solution is given by \eqref{eq:SFS_theory:pw_circ_ref} in terms of the virtual field's local wavenumber vector.
However, as a result, amplitude correct synthesis at a given time instant is ensured only over an arc for which part of the reference curve a stationary SSD element exist.

Alternatively, as the simplest solution, synthesis may be optimized to the center of the SSD array by decreasing the radius of the concentric reference circle to zero, e.g. the center of the SSD is chosen as a reference point $\vxref$.
Simulation results showed that this referencing strategy in case of a circular array constitutes a high frequency approximation of Near Field Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics \cite{Schultz2019:HOA_vs_WFS}.
In this geometry in the center of the array amplitude correct synthesis may be achieved independently from the virtual source trajectory over the entire source pass-by.
Furthermore, as it was presented in the foregoing, in this receiver position anti-aliased and nearly full-band synthesis can be ensured.
