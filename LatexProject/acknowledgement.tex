\fscom{check consistent use of vector product notation}

\fscom{check Fourier transform vs. Fourier Transform}

\fscom{check if/how driving function final results could be marked/boxed for easier finding within the manuscript}

\fscom{check if/how 'application examples' could be more emphasized within TOC or marked/boxed for easier finding within the manuscript}

\fscom{be consistent and concise with usage of 'target sound field /primary sound field / primary source /secondary source'}

\fscom{a overwiev table with results for the principle radii/curvatures/phase functions and its derivatives and all the inherent links at least for the 2.5D SDM / WFS of a point source would be very helful when recalculating all the derivations}

\fscom{since for plane waves the SPA and SDM not holds in strictly sense, you might show the limiting case for a point source very far away, reducing to no curvarture?? this should end in plane wave drinfing functions, or? I've checked this at once numerically once with the parallel / ref point referencing}
