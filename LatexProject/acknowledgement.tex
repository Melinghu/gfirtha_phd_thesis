\fscom{check consistent use of vector product notation}

\fscom{check Fourier transform vs. Fourier Transform}

\fscom{check if/how driving function final results could be marked/boxed for easier finding within the manuscript}

\fscom{check if/how 'application examples' could be more emphasized within TOC or marked/boxed for easier finding within the manuscript}

\fscom{be consistent and concise with usage of 'target sound field /primary sound field / primary source /secondary source'}

\fscom{a overwiev table with results for the principle radii/curvatures/phase functions and its derivatives and all the inherent links at least for the 2.5D SDM / WFS of a point source would be very helful when recalculating all the derivations}

\fscom{since for plane waves the SPA and SDM not holds in strictly sense, you might show the limiting case for a point source very far away, reducing to no curvarture?? this should end in plane wave drinfing functions, or? I've checked this at once numerically once with the parallel / ref point referencing }

\fscom{Section, Appendix, Figure...consistently large}

\fscom{in simulations kHz instead of krad/s}

\fscom{change 'SSD elements' to 'secondary sources'}

FG comments:\\
Do I need $\Omega \in \mathcal{R}^n$?  
To add: Fraunhofer region vs Fresnel region

Nomenclature:
\begin{itemize}
\item Wave Field Synthesis, Spectral Division Method (w capital), sound field synthesis, stationary phase approximation (w small)
\item Rayleigh integral, Kirchhoff integral, etc. (wo dash)
\item 
wavefront,
wavefield,
sound field, 
farfield,
high frequency 
wavefield extrapolation
free field,
free space,
source-free,
steady-state,
\item traveling
\item vspace(3mm) is used!
\item time-harmonic/ specral/ wavenumber domain etc. should be predefined
item $f$ for frequency is not defined (BTW, $\omega$ is not defined either)
\item Ordering citations (in case of multiple citation)
\item check figures: $\vn(\vxo)$ vs $\vn$
\item Check 2.33
\item figure vs. Figure in body text?
\end{itemize}
